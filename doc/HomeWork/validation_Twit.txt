Yeah he played in a small stadium but most of his homers cleared the fence by about 30-40 feet?

bryce harper is awesome ! lets go nats?
Guy was beast?
I love you Mike Trout?
S. Rodriguez is the best defensive player on the Pirates. I would love to see a defensive highlight reel of his.
Helton's play and the way he just ran in to the dugout has me laughing everytime!
On his way back! #Darvish #Rangers

#Yu #Darvish is the first #Rangers pitcher to win at least 10 games in his 1st 3 @MLB seasons.
Kim's adjusting just fine and he will continue doing better, I'm sure of it.
@scottmerkin Have a great year #john Danks!!
Simmons is the best shortstop in baseball as of now.
This is awesome!!! Atta boy pujols
Dustin Pedroia? twice nice grab!
Nice job?
Robinson catch was fucking beautiful?
I love you cesar?
Nationals pleased with Daniel Murphy¡¯s work on defense
Daniel Murphy on his defensive improvement
Daniel Murphy is a machine. Go 
Daniel Murphy is a grown man.
Daniel Murphy is everything we needed this offseason.
I'm not hating. I'm glad Daniel Murphy is playing well.
Another Daniel Murphy goal!!!
Daniel Murphy isn't doing bad
FUCK YOU JIM JOYCE?
That Jerry Mills (Meals?) call is the worst call I have ever seen. Jesus christ?
I think both hits were of the infield variety, and he seemed to have trouble getting under pretty routine fly balls to LF (though he made all the plays that came his way).
I watched Kim's debut and was not impressed.
Konner Lare apparently he's an asshole?
Puig is so overrated.
Puigs basics are very bad .he will cost more games with his ego than with his knowledge of the game?
I can't stand puig or harper because they both are cocky, pompous, assholes but AT LEAST HARPER HUSTLES!
puig always has been a little bitch.
puig is so arrogant?
Puig is such an overrated player and acts like he's the best in baseball.
No wonder why every pitcher in the MLB throws at him. He's a punk bitch.
