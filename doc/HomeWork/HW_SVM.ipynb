    "# 한국 메이저리거 현지 평가 및 분석\n",
    "## 1. 개요\n",
    "* Naive Bayes 이론을 이용한 현지 여론 분석\n",
    "* 한국인 메이저리거 여론을 평가하기 위해 트위터 게시물 검색\n",
    "* 학습된 분류기를 이용하여 긍정적인 여론이면 1, 비판적인 여론이면 0으로 분류\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. 연구방법\n",
    "* https://twitter.com/ 사이트의 검색 기능을 활용하여 자료 수집\n",
    "* 키워드를 활용하여 자료 수집\n",
    "* 한계 : 한국 이름과 미국 이름 쓰는 방식의 차이에서 오는 문제점 (예: 박병호 - Byungho, Byungho park, park, etc.. 주로 twins - park 을 많이 쓰지만 park 으로 검색시 원하지않는 결과 검색)\n",
    "* 수정 : '한국 메이저리거'가 아닌 '전체 메이저리거'에 대한 긍정적, 부정적 여론을 수집\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 데이터 수집\n",
    "* 긍정적인 트윗과 부정적인 트윗의 숫자는 188개, 112개 저장. (사전확률은 0.5로 가정)\n",
    "* 선수 검색의 경우 트윗에서 여러번 등장할 수 있기 때문에 긍정 혹은 비판적인 여론과 관계 없이 선수 이름 제거 후 저장\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. 분류기 학습 및 테스트\n",
    "* 트위터 -> 단어 벡터로 변경 (split() 함수 사용)\n",
    "* 알파벳을 제외한 문자 제거\n",
    "* 중복되지만 의미없는 단어들 제거 (선수 이름, I, a etc..)\n",
    "* 수집한 데이터를 사용하여 학습 후 (긍정 148개, 부정 100개), 메이저 리거 트위터를 분류기에 넣어서 평가 (긍정 40개, 부정 12개)\n"
